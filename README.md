Tonic is a package manager for Javascript and Typescript built on top of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). It's a simple, fast, and flexible as wanted from any package manager. It's restricited under the amount of commands you can use, but it's flexible enough to be used by anyone allowing for easy use software. Here's a brief overview of our motive:
We believe in the power of community and working to make ideas reality. Part of that is open-sourced and community-driven which is probably the most important thing as we are a community of developers who love to build software, packages do just that, promoting open-source and community-driven software giving us a way to provide for the community and the way of many other lifes. However, all of that is nothing without keeping the program to standards the community has set. To solve this we are constantly looking for new ideas to implement to are package manager alot by the community.

## Installation
As of right now, Tonic is not at a stable state of development. Therefore is not yet ready for production.
