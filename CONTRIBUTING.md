Contributing rules and information

**NOTE:** All all code distributed *must* show credit to their original creators

## Issues
Issues are some of the little things you can do but can make a big difference. Creating issues allows us to efficiently push out new fixes/enhancements faster then usual. We are asking you to check if the issue exists by using a quick search, otherwise feel free to [create one](https://github.com/risphs/tonic/issues).

## Pull Requests
We are open to pull-requests since it reduces the time we need to push out extra content/bug fixes. When creating a PR check that you have the latest version since merging older versions of code may increase the chances for bugs to happen. Pull requests can be made [here](https://github.com/risphs/tonic/pulls).

- Please don't write any code to a specific certain packages since these will not be merged to certain packages as these won't be merged to the master branch.
